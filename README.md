There are 4 demos.  Demos 3 and 4 require a Selenuim Grid to be running locally at 127.0.0.1:4444.<br/>
To quickly create and launch one download VisGrid at http://codoid.com/visgrid/.<br/>

**Run the demo of both browsers in the grid simultaneously**:  npm run xbrowserdemo

Please make sure that you have the latest versions of the Google Chrome Driver and the Mozilla GeckoDriver
installed.  You can check for these on http://seleniumhq.org/download. The drivers will
need to be placed in a folder that is pathed.
